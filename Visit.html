                <p>Shown on the right here is the ruins of Eglinton Castle.<br>
                    Englinton Castle is actually technically in a town called Kilwinning, but it is very close to Irvine. <br>
                    The castle was built in the 18th century and was the home of the Montgomerie family. <br>
                    The castle was destroyed by fire in 1920 and has been a ruin ever since. <br>
                    The castle is now a public park and is a popular place for walks and picnics. <br>
                    Robert Burns, the famous Scottish poet, was a friend of the Montgomerie family and he wrote a poem about the castle. <br>
