Stage 1 

Initially starting this project was hard as I wasn't able to find a motto/slogan and cannot find the year my town (Irvine) was founded.
I drew on a piece of paper the layout i wanted my index page to be then i started to code it and make it as similar as possible.
BY FAR the trickiest thing i had to do was make my page look good on mobile which initially i did not know what to do, so i watched some tutorials on how to implement it to this project and had a few misses and a few hits; creating the menu for mobile was extremely hard and my buttons which i have tried to add are still not currently working. (hopefully there is an update on this later)
I decided to basically type random string's into places where i would put my real text to help with designing the layout of my page. Rather than stopping and thinking about what text i should add.

Stage 2

I have now created all the pages which are index.html, Visit.html and history.html I still need to top each page up with more information however I am now comtemplating creating a gallery page to show off my town.
I have stuck to the basic/modern look of picture then text to the right and vice versa. 
I am also currently thinking of adding a footer to my pages as having nothing at the bottom of my page looks bland.
Finding places to visit and history of where i live is pretty hard as the only information i can get is from wikipedia as well as the fact that my town doesn't have a lot of excitement about it so my content can't actually be as long as I want it.
Buttons for the menu are still not working yet (I've gave up to crack on with other things)
I also managed to remove the background of my Irvine logo, managed to do this on photoshop after watching tutorials. Was really proud of this.

Stage 3
I managed to incorporate my icons so the mobile display looks perfect for the website, I edited some code to tidy it up and fixed some mistakes, added a footer but I am unsure on the 7:5 ratio for visit.html. I also did not use bootstrap for layout, may lose marks here. 
I have updated my pages and they all look fresh, added a footer but decided to not add a gallery for my home town.

Eval/Conclusion

Starting this project was challenging in multiple ways. As soon as i would fix one problem, another one would arise out of nowhere such as minimising my browser and my text suddenly runs over images etc but this was solved pretty quickly and soon understood how to fix such problems pretty efficiently. I enjoyed speaking to people about their websites and understanding their viewpoints on their work. Before taking this class I had 0 knowledge on any front-end development as I have never done CS before coming to university however this course has already taught me key skills which I will use for years to come.
