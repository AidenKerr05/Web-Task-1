Initially starting this project was hard as I wasn't able to find a motto/slogan and cannot find the year my town (Irvine) was founded.
I drew on a piece of paper the layout i wanted my index page to be then i started to code it and make it as similar as possible.
BY FAR the trickiest thing i had to do was make my page look good on mobile which initially i did not know what to do, so i watched some tutorials on how to implement it to this project and had a few misses and a few hits; creating the menu for mobile was extremely hard and my buttons which i tried to implement were not working for mobile. Geneuinely took me hours trying to find a solution for this.
